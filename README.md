### What the project does

This project focuses on classifying red and white wines based on their characteristics using machine learning models. The provided Python scripts utilize popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas to perform classification tasks on wine datasets. The project includes two main scripts:

1. **Classification and Cross-Validation (Script 1)**
   - The script loads a red wine dataset (`red_wine.csv`) and performs 10-fold cross-validation on various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM-Linear, SVM-RBF, and Random Forest.
   - The performance metrics, including Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Accuracy, are calculated and displayed in a DataFrame.

2. **Random Forest Classifier and ROC Curve (Script 2)**
   - This script loads a red wine dataset (`red_wine.csv`) and focuses on the Random Forest Classifier.
   - It splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains the Random Forest classifier, and generates a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to visualize the model's performance.

3. **White Wine Classification and Cross-Validation (Script 3)**
   - Similar to the first script, this script loads a white wine dataset (`white_wine.csv`) and performs 10-fold cross-validation on the same set of machine learning models.
   - AUC and Accuracy scores for each model are calculated and displayed in a DataFrame.

### Why the project is useful

Wine classification based on characteristics is a common task in the beverage industry. Automating this process through machine learning models can save time and resources. The project provides a foundation for building predictive models for wine type classification, enabling users to explore and understand the performance of different algorithms.
